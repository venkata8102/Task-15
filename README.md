Selenium is a popular open source framework for automated testing of web applications across multiple browsers, operating systems, and devices.

Selenium makes it easier for developers to create automated tests for web applications without having to worry about the underlying technology. Before Selenium, testing a web application was a time-consuming process. You had to manually perform different scenarios on various browsers to identify issues in the user experience.

The Selenium project offers built-in support for 5 languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and Ruby. Python has the advantage of being easy to learn and versatile, and it's popular among developers. It also offers powerful built-in functions and an expansive ecosystem of libraries that make it easy to write nearly any kind of script, and it's well-suited for test automation.
